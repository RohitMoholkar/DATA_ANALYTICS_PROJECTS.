## I have included Data Analysis Projects covering various aspects, all implemented using Python, in this repository. 

### About Data Analytics:
Data analytics, is the process of examining raw data to uncover insights, trends, and patterns that can inform decision-making and drive business strategies. It involves gathering, cleaning, processing, and interpreting data to extract meaningful information. Data analytics utilizes various techniques and tools, including statistical analysis,data visualization, to transform data into actionable insights. By understanding and analyzing data, organizations can gain valuable insights in multiple domains, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimize their performance. 

### Project1 Description. 
- Project Name: **WEBSCRAPER INSIGHTS: ANALYZING THANE'S RENTAL MARKET DYNAMICS.** 
- Abstract: The project "WEBSCRAPER INSIGHTS: ANALYZING THANE'S RENTAL MARKET DYNAMICS" delves into Thane's rental market using real-world data obtained from NoBroker.com. Python programming language serves as the backbone of this project, supported by essential libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium for web scraping tasks. Data visualization is facilitated by Matplotlib and Seaborn, while pandas remains integral for data manipulation and analysis throughout the project. The extracted dataset comprises approximately 2478 rows and 10 columns. Through meticulous analysis, the project uncovers trends, patterns, and insights crucial for both tenants and landlords. Stakeholders gain actionable intelligence through data visualization and statistical analysis, aiding decision-making processes and strategic planning in the rental market. This project offers a comprehensive exploration of various aspects of the rental market landscape. Ultimately, this project aims to foster dialogue, innovation, and collaboration toward creating sustainable rental communities. 
- For a comprehensive overview, please refer to the Project1 report PDF provided above.
- The scraped data file, CSV file, is also available above for your reference.
- The output for the web scraping section of the code has been cleared to address memory issues, as it was consuming a significant amount of memory. The entire file occupied approximately 38MB, exceeding the 25MB limit imposed by GitHub. However, I have also included the file (Project1_webscraping_op) containing the output for the web scraping part for those interested. You can download and examine it separately. 

### Project2 Description. 
- Project Name: **EXPLORING JOB POSTINGS DATA: UNVEILING PATTERNS AND TRENDS.**
- The project aims to analyze a large dataset of job postings, spanning two years, to uncover insights and trends in job sectors, industries, and roles.
- This project is divided into three important data analytics project steps: Step 1 involves loading and gaining a basic understanding of the dataset, Step 2 focuses on data cleaning and processing and Step 3 entails proper data analysis. 
- Initially, imported all necessary libraries for the project for data analysis and visualization, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and JSON. Obtained the dataset from Kaggle.com, which contains detailed job posting-related information. Loaded the dataset into the 'df' variable. The dataset contains 1,615,940 rows and 23 columns, making it considerably large data.
- I performed comprehensive data preprocessing, I proceeded with several essential tasks to ensure the dataset's integrity and suitability for analysis. Initially, I focused on removing unnecessary columns and eliminating rows with missing values to streamline the dataset. Additionally, I introduced new columns to enrich the dataset's insights. Following this, I corrected the datatype of columns to ensure accurate analysis. One column, presented in JSON format, required special attention. I parsed the data and extracted valuable information to create new columns, enhancing the dataset's depth. To improve comprehension during analysis, I rearranged the columns. As a result of these preprocessing steps, the dataset now boasts 1,610,462 rows and 15 columns, primed for effective analysis and insightful discoveries. 
- In the main data analysis section, I uncovered numerous insights by conducting in-depth exploration of the dataset. Using various analytical techniques, I plotted diverse graphs, created informative dataframes, and detailed key findings derived from the analysis. The dataset encompasses two years of job postings, spanning from September 15, 2021, to September 15, 2023. Across the analyses, I utilized a range of visualization methods including bar graphs, pie charts, and heatmaps to depict trends and patterns. Insights were gleaned regarding job sectors, industries, job roles, and more. For a comprehensive overview, please refer to the accompanying ipynb file named Project2 located above.
